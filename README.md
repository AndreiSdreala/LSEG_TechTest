### Application consists of a simple chatbot; the toggler for the chatbox is bottom-right corner of the display.

### Based on the mock-up I assumed the dialogue could be in the form of button selection, since we are working with predefined data in JSON format.

### Data from JSON is imported and buttons are created dynamically for each menu.

### The application is run on localhost with VSCode Live Server extension. 
### Simply clone the repository, install Live Server inside VSCode then click on the action bar button for Live Server on bottom-right inside the project directory.
